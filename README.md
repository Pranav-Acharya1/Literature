Stuff which I have written.

'Introduction to Gated Spin Quantum Dot Quantum Computers' is my Literature review for my Theoretical Physics MPhys. It covers the basics of qubit based quantum computing implementations with a focus and explanation of gated spin quantum dot computers. It is intended as an introductory paper for those relatively new to quantum computing, but have undergraduate knowledge of physics.
